**LibChronicles** is an exploration of Go’s standard library history and evolution, serving both as a way to understand the language’s growth and as a personal journey into the Go ecosystem. By starting with simple visualizations and progressively building out the scope and complexity, **LibChronicles** will provide insights into Go’s standard library over time, as well as its broader development direction.

### **Current Focus**
The project begins with manual Tableau visualizations and a focus on exploring the **standard library** through foundational questions:
1. **Top-Level Packages**: Which packages were introduced at each Go version?
2. **Historical Snapshots**: How has the standard library changed between specific versions (e.g., v1.18 and v1.19)?

These initial visualizations will serve as the groundwork for deeper analysis and more advanced tools.

### **Goals**
1. **Visualization Goals**:
   - Start with simple views, such as top-level packages introduced in each version.
   - Expand to comparisons of entire Go versions, focusing on changes (e.g., added functions, updated types).
   - Experiment with different visualization techniques to highlight trends and insights effectively.

2. **Data Collection Goals**:
   - Scrape and parse entire historical versions of the standard library.
   - Define the data to collect, such as:
     - **Package Metadata**: Name, introduction version, and dependencies.
     - **Type Metadata**: Structs, interfaces, and their methods.
     - **Function Metadata**: Top-level and associated methods.
     - **Changelog Integration**: Align code changes with release notes to identify updates or decisions not directly reflected in the code.
   - Track updates to standard library items over time to understand their lifecycle (e.g., when a function gains parameters or changes behavior).

3. **Contextual Insights**:
   - Examine major decisions affecting Go’s direction (e.g., concurrency model changes, generics introduction).
   - Integrate additional data sources, such as Go Proverbs, to explore shifts in the language’s philosophy.

### **Architecture**
The architecture will evolve alongside the project, but here’s the planned progression:
1. **Initial Data Shape**:
   - Focus on snapshots of Go’s standard library for individual versions.
   - Build JSON datasets with metadata for top-level packages, types, and functions.
   - Annotate changes between versions for comparisons.

2. **Comparison Tools**:
   - Develop methods for tracking differences between versions (e.g., v1.18 vs. v1.19).
   - Leverage Tableau to handle straightforward comparisons (e.g., counts of added packages or functions).
   - Address challenges in tracking updates, such as identifying subtle changes to existing elements.

3. **Future Directions**:
   - Potential graph-based visualization tools to represent the library as an interconnected system (e.g., dependencies between packages).
   - Additional data sources for broader context, such as release notes, language design proposals (Go LDPs), and even community discussions.

### **Broader Vision**
**LibChronicles** aims to create a rich, multidimensional perspective on Go's evolution, bridging technical data with the human decisions that shaped the language. This journey isn’t just about collecting data but also about uncovering patterns, philosophy, and the story behind Go’s growth.
